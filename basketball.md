# Basketball!

## Let's make a Basketball Game! @unplugged
In this session we will do our best to make a kind of "Free Throw" style Basketball game!

In this game, your player will move back and forth, while trying to throw the ball into the net.

### Create/ Choose Background 
First, we are going to create a background for the game. To do this, go into the ToolBox and find the ``||scene:Scene||`` category. 
Then locate the block that says ``||scene:set background image to||`` and click and drag it onto your ``||loops:on start||`` block. 
By clicking on the white square an image editor will open up. Try to draw your own Basketball key, or select the **Gallery** option at the top of the screen and select a background that you like.  

Click **Done** when you are finished and the new background you chose will show up in the simulator on the left side of the screen.
